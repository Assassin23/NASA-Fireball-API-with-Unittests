## NASA Fireball API with Unittests
### Use NASA’s public HTTP APIs to create a function which determines which of three locations has seen the brightest shooting stars since 2017.


## Implement a function fireball():

### Object fireball(double latitude, double longitude)

### When there is enough data to do so, the function should return the brightness and location for the brightest shooting star seen since 2017 at the given location.

### The brightness should be determined using the energy from each shooting star (a higher ‘energy’ meaning a brighter star).

### You can use the https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/fireball.html API to get the information you will need to compute this.

### With your fireball() function, determine which of three locations had the brightest shooting star since 2017. Print out the location and brightness for that star.

### Use these Locations to figure out which saw the brightest star since 2017 (2017-01-01 -> 2019-01-01)

## Boston - latitude: 42.354558N, longitude: 71.054254W 
## NCR - latitude: 28.574389N, longitude: 77.312638E 
## San Francisco - latitude: 37.793700N, longitude: 122.403906W
